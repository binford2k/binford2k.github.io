          Bavaria, also known as Bayern, is Germany's largest land state, and is
          well known for its beautiful, old-world charm. They like their coffee
          strong and sweet, and the same goes for their booze.

          This cocktail adds a winter warmer of peppermint schnapps for the taste
          of sweet, minty, creamy coffee that we all dream of during the holidays.
        </p>
        <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>6 oz hot coffee</li>
          <li>½ oz peppermint schnapps</li>
          <li>½ oz Kahlua</li>
          <li>Sugar to taste</li>
          <li>Whipped Cream</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Fill your glass about ¾ with hot coffee. Add the schnapps, Kahlua, and
          sweeten to taste.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slowly pour the cream so that it rests on top.
