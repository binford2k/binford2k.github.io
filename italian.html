          The secret ingredient is Strega. The recipe of this liqueur has been a
          secret since 1860 when it was first produced in Campania, Italy.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's an herbal blend, golden in color from its infusion with saffron.
          When mixed with hot coffee, it releases a wild aroma of mint, fennel
          and juniper, along with over 60 other herbal ingredients.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a bright, light-bodied liqueur that packs a punch of up to 80
          proof. The word Strega is Italian for "witch", from the alleged
          witchcraft that dates back centuries in the area.
        </p>
