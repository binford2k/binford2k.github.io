description: |-
  The classic Old Fashioned is a staple for us, especially this year. A hefty
  dose of bourbon--whichever has caught our fancy this week--with a touch of sweet
  and bitters, then topped off with a twist of citrus.

  But let's shake things up for fall, shall we?

  This recipe uses brown sugar and apple cider for the sweetness, and then rounds
  things out with some fall spice.
ingredients:
  - 2 oz apple cider
  - 2 oz bourbon
  - 1 tsp brown sugar or other sweetener
  - 1 cinnamon stick
  - dash or two of Angostora bitters
  - orange slice
  - (optional) slice of apple, persimmon, or other fruit

Muddle the brown sugar and apple juice until fully dissolved. Maple syrup would
make an excellent sweetener as well.

Swirl in the bourbon and add 1-2 large ice cubes.

Shake in a dash or two of the bitters.

Top with the cinnamon stick, fruit slices.
