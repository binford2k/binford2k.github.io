description: |-
  Everyone loves a hot buttered rum. This take on it uses bourbon for a bit more
  warming kick, and the hand made spiced butter mix is made with coconut oil.

  This gives you a richer flavor, with just a hint of the tropics we're looking
  forward to again.
ingredients:
  - 2 oz bourbon
  - 2 oz apple cider
  - 1 tbsp spiced butter mix
  - 1 cinnamon stick

Gently warm the cider, either by microwaving for 30 seconds at a time or heating
in a small saucepan on your stove.

Mix the hot cider and bourbon, then stir in a hefty spoonful of the butter mix.
Stir until it fully melts.

Sprinkle ground cinnamon on top if you have it, then drop in a cinnamon stick.
