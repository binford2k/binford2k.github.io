  This drink isn't particularly complex. When you're half frostbitten and just
  need to come in and warm up, you don't have time for the frills.

  Just give me the goods, and make it strong!
ingredients:
  - 4 oz hot cocoa
  - 2 oz Aquavit
  - Whipped cream of your preference
---
Fill your mug about Â¾ with hot cocoa. Stir in the aquavit and top with whatever
kind of cream you prefer. Shaking up some heavy cream or half & half will work
nicely, but use whatever cream you have on hand.

If you do feel extra fancy, garnish with spices, marshmallows, cocoa bits.

Wrap both hands around the mug and breathe in deeply before your first sip.
