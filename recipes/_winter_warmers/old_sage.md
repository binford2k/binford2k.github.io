title:  The Old Sage

description: |-
  There’s a certain comfort that comes with sipping a hot toddy. The heat
  relieves that seemingly impenetrable chill in the bones and brings solace when
  your hands are cold and somehow your feet in their boots are colder. The toddy
  does not discriminate your choice of liquor. It just does its job and warms you up.

  This concoction uses that delightful Scandinavian aquavit to bring out the
  herbal notes of black tea. If caraway isn't your thing, you could always use
  bourbon, brandy, or other liquor bold enough to hold its own.
ingredients:
  - 4 oz hot black tea
  - 1 ½ oz Aquavit
  - 1 teaspoon honey
  - splash of lemon juice, to taste
  - 2 sage leaves
  - 1 twist orange

Dissolve honey into hot black tea in a heat-tempered glass. Add Aquavit and
lemon juice and stir. Carefully twist and pinch the orange peel over the glass
to release a small amount of oil.

Garnish with fresh sage leaves and any fall spices that catch your fancy.
