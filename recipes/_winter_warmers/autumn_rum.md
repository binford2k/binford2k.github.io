  Did you know that Old Fashioned is the name for the style of cocktail and not
  necessarily the type of liquor in it? This recipe uses dark rum and fall spices
  to warm your belly.
ingredients:
  - 2 oz dark rum
  - 1 oz apple cider
  - 1 tsp of a sweetener; brown sugar, honey, maple syrup, or sugar cube
  - 3 dashes Angostora bitters
  - twist of orange peel
  - (optional) thin round of apple
---
Shake or stir the rum, cider, and sugar.

Strain into a lowball glass over ice.

Carefully twist and pinch the orange peel over the glass to release a small
amount of oil. Drop the peel in.

Float the apple round on top.
