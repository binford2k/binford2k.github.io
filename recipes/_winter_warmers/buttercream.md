title:  Butter Cream

description: |-
  The hot buttered rum is one of the best known and loved winter cocktails. But
  if you have a splash of milk, you can turn it into something truly exquisite.
  And if you've got coconut cream instead, then you're in for a real treat.

  If not, then be creative or just enjoy the classic.

  The handmade spiced butter mix we've shared is made with coconut oil for a hint
  of the exotic.
ingredients:
  - 2 oz dark rum
  - 4 oz hot water (or milk to taste)
  - 1 heaping tablespoon of spiced butter mix.
  - 1 cinnamon stick
  - 1 star anise

Mix the run and hot water/milk.

Stir in the spiced butter mix until fully melted.

Top with a cinnamon stick and star anise. Dust with ground cinnamon if you have it.
