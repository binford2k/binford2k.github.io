description: |-
  The secret ingredient is Strega. The recipe of this liqueur has been a secret
  since 1860 when it was first produced in Campania, Italy.

  It's an herbal blend, golden in color from its infusion with saffron. When mixed
  with hot coffee, it releases a wild aroma of mint, fennel and juniper, along with
  over 60 other herbal ingredients.

  It is a bright, light-bodied liqueur that packs a punch of up to 80 proof. The
  word Strega is Italian for "witch", from the alleged witchcraft that dates back
  centuries in the area.
ingredients:
  - 5 oz hot coffee
  - ½ oz Strega
  - 1 teaspoon sugar
  - 1 ½ oz whipped cream
  - nutmeg

Rim a glass by moistening and carefully pressing it into the sugar.

Pour coffee and Strega into a hot, Irish coffee glass and add about a teaspoon
of sugar. Float some cream on top and sprinkle with nutmeg.
