image:  /images/french.jpg
description: |-
  Rather than whiskey, the French prefer Cognac for the alcohol and Amaretto
  for the flavor. A typical French Connection is equal parts cognac and
  Amaretto liqueur on ice.

  When served with hot coffee however, it often goes by the name of *Cafe Amore*.
ingredients:
  - Hot coffee
  - 1 oz Cognac
  - 1 oz Amaretto
  - Shaved almonds
  - Whipped cream
---
Rim a glass by moistening and carefully pressing it into the sugar.

Add an ounce of Cognac and an ounce of Amaretto to a warmed glass then fill the
rest with hot, black coffee.

For the real deal, top with whipped cream and shaved almonds.
