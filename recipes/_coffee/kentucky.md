description: |-
  Kentucky is known for its bourbon, so what better alcohol to mix with coffee
  could there be for the authentic taste of the American South?
ingredients:
  - 1 oz bourbon
  - ½ oz Kahlua
  - Dash of vanilla extract
  - Sugar to taste
  - Whipped cream
  - 6 oz hot coffee
---
Fill your glass about ¾ with hot coffee. Add the bourbon, Kahlua, and a splash
of vanilla.

Sweeten with sugar to taste, and slowly pour the cream so that it rests on top.

Sit back and enjoy the taste of the South.
