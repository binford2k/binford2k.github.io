image:  /images/mexican.jpg
description: |-
  In Mexico, coffee is often brewed with cinnamon and sugar, incorporated right
  into the brewing technique. The result is a coffee that's at the same time
  sweet and spicy. The Mexican coffee cocktail has a similar vibe.
ingredients:
  - ½ oz Kahlua
  - ½ oz tequila
  - 6 oz hot coffee
  - Sugar to taste
  - Whipped cream
  - cinnamon
  - One star anise (optional)
  - chili flakes to taste
  - Maraschino cherry

Rim a glass by moistening with a lime wedge and carefully pressing it into the
sugar.

Fill your glass about ¾ with hot coffee. Add the tequila, Kahlua, and sweeten to
taste. Drop in a star anise, if desired.

Slowly pour the cream so that it rests on top, then top with cinnamon and a
Maraschino cherry. Add chili to give it an extra kick.

Try it floated with vanilla ice cream for the real down South taste!
