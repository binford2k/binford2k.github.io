image:  /images/bavarian.jpg
description: |-
  Bavaria, also known as Bayern, is Germany's largest land state, and is well
  known for its beautiful, old-world charm. They like their coffee strong and
  sweet, and the same goes for their booze.

  This cocktail adds a winter warmer of peppermint schnapps for the taste of
  sweet, minty, creamy coffee that we all dream of during the holidays.
ingredients:
  - 6 oz hot coffee
  - ½ oz peppermint schnapps
  - ½ oz Kahlua
  - Sugar to taste
  - Whipped Cream
---
Fill your glass about ¾ with hot coffee. Add the schnapps, Kahlua, and sweeten
to taste.

Slowly pour the cream so that it rests on top.
