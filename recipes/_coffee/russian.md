  What Russian cocktail would be complete without copious amounts of vodka?

  This cocktail is certainly not for the lactose intolerant, as it's roughly
  equal amounts of coffee, cream, and liquor.
ingredients:
  - 3 oz hot coffee
  - 2 oz heavy cream
  - 1 oz Kahlua
  - 1 oz vodka
  - Whipped Cream

Fill your glass about Â½ with hot coffee. Add the cream, Kahlua, and vodka, then
garnish with whipped cream.

Shout "God Save the Tsar!" and then down the drink and make another.
